/** Core Data Easy Fetch Category
 *
 * This is an Objective-C category for Core Data (`NSManagedObjectContext
 * (EasyFetch)`) that offers a few useful functions added that simplify [Core
 * Data][1] programming for Mac OS X and iPhone OS. It's based loosely on
 * [code][2] by Matt Gallagher, but with several enhancements and modifications
 * that I needed for a project I was writing that used Core Data.
